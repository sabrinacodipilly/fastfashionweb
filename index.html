      <p>Fast fashion can be defined as rapidly producing high volumes of new clothing for marketing. We all are consumers of fast fashion when we shop at stores such as, H&M, Forever 21, Zara, and so many more. But why is all of this so bad? Fast fashion promotes the trend of only wearing clothes once. People feel the need to be constantly buying new clothes to wear instead of rewearing the clothes they already have. Additionally, fast fashion also promotes trends in which people will end up throwing out their clothes after that trend is over. This causes a lot of waste of our natural resources and more pollution on our Earth.</p>

      <p>Another reason why fast fashion is so bad is due to the treatment of the workers who make these clothes. They work in sweatshops and are referred to as sweatshop workers. They are forced to work in terrible conditions, work overtime, and earn less than living wage.</p>
