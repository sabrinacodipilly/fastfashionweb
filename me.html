    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p id = "aboutMe">Hi! My name is Sabrina, and I made this website through the Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program. Environmental justice is a passion of mine, and I always like to specifically focus on fast fashion since fashion is a big part of my life. I have tried doing my part in saving this planet by only buying second-hand clothing and by taking on the no new clothes pledge. Hopefully this website will inspire you or help you learn more about this cause!</p>
