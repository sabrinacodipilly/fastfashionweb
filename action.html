    <h1>What YOU Can Do</h1>
    <h3>Sign the <a href ="https://thefabricact.org/petition" id = "link">Fabric Act Petition!</a></h3>
    <h4>By signing this petition, sweatshops in the U.S. will come to an end, and jobs with dignity can be created.</h4>
    <h3>Buy second-hand clothing and be an outfit repeater!</h3>
    <h4>By buying second-hand clothing, you can reduce the amount of clothes that go to waste. Also, by repeating your outfits or by wearing clothing items more than once, you will discover that you do not need so many new clothes.</h4>
    <h3>Develop your own personal style!</h3>
    <h4>Instead of buying only clothing that is trending, you can create your own personal style by buying pieces you know you will love for a long time. Trends are always coming and going, leading to more and more waste in clothing since people don't want to wear those clothes anymore.</h4>
